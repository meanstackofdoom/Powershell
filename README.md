## check_enrolment.ps1

<p>Check out the Teams enrolled intune script on GitHub:</p>

<a href="https://github.com/meanstackofdoom/Powershell-Scripts-Teams/blob/main/intune_check_enrolled.ps1">Device Enrollment</a>

This script is designed to monitor Intune-managed devices and send notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel when new devices are enrolled within the last 6 hours. It continues to run indefinitely<br><br>

The script performs the following tasks:<br>
1. Checks for the presence of the "Microsoft.Graph.Intune" PowerShell module and installs it if missing.<br>
2. Establishes a connection to Microsoft Graph.<br>
3. Updates the Microsoft Graph environment schema to the beta version.<br>
4. Calculates a time threshold to determine if any devices were enrolled within a specified time frame (default is 6 hours).<br>
5. Queries Intune-managed devices that meet the enrollment criteria.<br>
6. Sends a message to a Microsoft Teams channel with details of the enrolled devices, if any.<br>
7. Repeats the monitoring process at regular intervals.<br>


.NOTES<br>
- You should replace the webhook URLs with your actual Microsoft Teams webhook URLs.<br>
- Customize the script as needed for your environment.<br>
- Ensure that the "Run-IntuneCheck" function, which is referenced but not defined in this script, is defined elsewhere in your environment.<br>
